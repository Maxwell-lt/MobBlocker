# Mob Blocker
Minecraft mod that helps with the first night

[CurseForge link](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mob-blocker)

## What is this?
Mob Blocker adds a single block: the **Chunk Protector**. This block will, for 3 days, protect the chunk it is placed in from all types of hostile mobs. Upon first entering a world, each player is gifted one of these blocks to use. It's recommended that they use it to assemble shelter at night while shielded from danger. After the Chunk Protector decays, you'd better have a wall up!
